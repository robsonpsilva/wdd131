                    My name is Robson. I live in Brazil, in the city of Rio de Janeiro. I currently work for an oil and gas company. I am married and have two daughters, a son and a granddaughter. They make me very happy and I am very grateful to have them in my life. I like to travel, go to the beach, watch good movies at the cinema, go to the theater to enjoy operas and classical orchestras. I am an electrical engineer by profession and I have a passion for science and technology.

                    <p>Rio de Janeiro, city, capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is located on the Atlantic Ocean, in the southeastern part of the tropical zone of South America, and is widely recognized as one of the worldâ€™s most beautiful and interesting urban centres. Although Rio de Janeiro continues to be the preeminent icon of Brazil in the eyes of many in the world, in reality its location, architecture, inhabitants, and lifestyle make it highly unique when compared with other Brazilian cities.
                       Rio de Janeiro state is one of the more urbanized and densely populated areas in Brazil, with the overwhelming majority of the population living in the city of Rio de Janeiro and other urban centres.
